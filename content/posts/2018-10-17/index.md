This right-hand-drive 1986 Land Rover 90 is one solid machine. The Causeway Grey exterior makes this 90 sleek and stout. Minor flaws can be seen upon close inspection but overall a decent paint job. The interior of this 90 is all stock with 3 seats across the front. Rear jump seats are installed too. The 2.5 diesel engine has plenty of pep and while some consider them slow it is one true workhorse. These 2.5NA engines were used by the British Military for some time. They were incredibly reliable and simple to fix in the field.
