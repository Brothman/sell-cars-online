Brooklyn Coachworks is offering this original 1987 Land Rover 110 for sale. This predates the “Defender” line. Land Rover introduced “Land Rover One Ten” in 1983 and ran to 1991 before the adoption of the Defender nameplate. This beautiful Trident green 110 has a gorgeous period correct paint job and interior in tan leather and tweed seats. The 110 has its original matching 2.5 Turbo Diesel engine with incredibly low miles. Matching 5-speed LT77 and 1.4 transfer case in high and low range paired with 3.54 differential gears. 6 freshly painted alpine white Genuine Land Rover 16” steel wheels with 7.50R16 (31”) Michelin XZL tires are fitted. We can fit this Defender 110 with a genuine Land Rover winch bumper and Warn M8000 winch if needed. We can also fit it with a roof rack too.
