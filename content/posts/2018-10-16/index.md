Timm Cooper is known as one of the best Land Rover builders out there. His builds are legendary and usually come with a ownership badge of honor as there are only a handful of examples out there. Timm is what Carroll Shelby is to Ford. You will always get a unique and highly respected Land Rover from Timm. This particular truck was built in California but spent most of its time on a farm in Hawaii, then back to the Seattle with Timm and until now has resided in New York. It sits on a 107” chassis with Series 80” front wings and bulkhead. The frame sits on leaf springs that are over Rovertracks converted Range Rover Classic 30 spline axles with Toyota differentials for extra heavy duty support. Non-assisted disc brakes on all wheels.
