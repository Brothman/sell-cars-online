With Range Roverâ€™s 50th Anniversary on the horizon we wanted to do a special build to commemorate the original and still, greatest luxury sport utility vehicle ever. We modeled these Range Rovers after the early 1970s models with various pastel colors, vertical grills, period correct badges, with thin tires on Rostyle wheels. We wanted to highlight the styling cues of the very first Classics which captured our imagination of what a luxury SUV should look like. Overall these Heritage Range Rovers Classics bring back the charm that Land Rover first brought to the luxury SUV market some 50 years ago.
