This amazing restored 1972 Land Rover Series III displays perfect patina. Tasteful and not overdone. The Genuine Land Rover Marine Blue comes off great in any light. Original 16‚Äù white steel wheels are fitted with 7.50X16 Bias MUD X-Tra Traction tires for an incredible look and drive. Old stock Land Rover headlight and rear light protection was added. Large tugboat rope on galvanized bumper. The entire chassis is galvanized so you will never develop rust for as long as this car is alive. This particular truck has been featured in Alloy+Grit Spring 2018 Issue and also has a gorgeous poster too.
